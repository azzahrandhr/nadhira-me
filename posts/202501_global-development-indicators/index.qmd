## Overview

Economic development is multidimensional. While GDP per capita captures material prosperity, it tells us little about whether citizens can read, whether children survive their first year, or whether growth reaches everyone equally. This analysis examines World Bank development indicators across 212 countries to understand how income relates to human development outcomes.

The key questions:

- How unequal is global income distribution?
- What patterns emerge when comparing the richest and poorest countries?
- Can simple regression models capture the relationships between income, education, and health?

## Data Preparation

The World Bank Development Indicators dataset contains panel data spanning 2015-2024 for multiple development metrics. The raw data requires substantial cleaning: removing regional aggregates, reshaping from wide to long format, and selecting the most recent available observation for each country-indicator pair.

```{stata data-prep, warning=FALSE}
*===============================================================================
* DATA IMPORT AND CLEANING
*===============================================================================

clear

* Import CSV with proper variable types
import delimited "wb_indicators_2015_2024.csv", varnames(1) ///
    numericcols(5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14)

* Examine initial data structure
describe

* Generate row ID and remove regional aggregates
* (entries after row 1085 are regional/world aggregates)
generate id = _n
keep if id < 1086

* Reshape from wide to long format
reshape long yr, i(id) j(year)
rename yr seriesvalue

* Sort and keep most recent non-missing value per country-indicator
gsort countrycode seriescode -year
keep if seriesvalue < .
gsort seriescode seriesname countrycode countryname -year
by seriescode seriesname countrycode countryname: keep if _n == 1
sort countryname seriescode

* Save cleaned long-format data
save "wb_cleaned_long.dta", replace
```

## Descriptive Statistics by Indicator

With the cleaned data, we examine the distribution of each development indicator across countries.

```{stata descriptive-stats, warning=FALSE}
* Load cleaned data
use "wb_cleaned_long.dta", clear

* Summary statistics by indicator
bysort seriesname: summarize seriesvalue
```

The summary statistics reveal substantial variation across all indicators. GDP per capita ranges from under \$300 to over \$100,000, while literacy rates span from 27% to nearly 100%.

## Preparing Data for Regression

To analyze relationships between indicators, we reshape the data to wide format where each country is one observation with separate columns for each indicator.

```{stata reshape-wide, warning=FALSE}
* Load cleaned data
use "wb_cleaned_long.dta", clear

* Rename series codes for readability
replace seriescode = "gdp" if seriescode == "NY.GDP.PCAP.CD"
replace seriescode = "female_literacy" if seriescode == "SE.ADT.LITR.FE.ZS"
replace seriescode = "male_literacy" if seriescode == "SE.ADT.LITR.MA.ZS"
replace seriescode = "adult_literacy" if seriescode == "SE.ADT.LITR.ZS"
replace seriescode = "mortality" if seriescode == "SP.DYN.IMRT.IN"

* Drop unnecessary variables and reshape wide
drop id year seriesname
reshape wide seriesvalue, i(countrycode countryname) j(seriescode) string

* Rename variables for clarity
rename seriesvaluegdp gdp
rename seriesvaluefemale_literacy female_literacy
rename seriesvaluemale_literacy male_literacy
rename seriesvalueadult_literacy adult_literacy
rename seriesvaluemortality mortality

* Save wide-format data for analysis
save "wb_cleaned_wide.dta", replace

describe
```

## Comparing Rich and Poor Countries

One of the starkest ways to visualize global inequality is to compare development outcomes between the richest and poorest countries by GDP per capita.

```{stata top-bottom-comparison, warning=FALSE}
* Load wide-format data
use "wb_cleaned_wide.dta", clear

* Top 50 countries by GDP per capita
display "=== TOP 50 COUNTRIES BY GDP PER CAPITA ==="
gsort -gdp
summarize adult_literacy female_literacy male_literacy mortality in 1/50

* Bottom 50 countries by GDP per capita
display ""
display "=== BOTTOM 50 COUNTRIES BY GDP PER CAPITA ==="
sort gdp
summarize adult_literacy female_literacy male_literacy mortality in 1/50
```

The gap is especially striking for infant mortality: the highest mortality rate among wealthy countries is lower than the lowest rate among poor countries—non-overlapping distributions that underscore systemic differences in health infrastructure.

## Distribution Analysis

The distribution of GDP per capita reveals important insights about global inequality.

```{stata distribution, warning=FALSE}
* Load wide-format data
use "wb_cleaned_wide.dta", clear

* Detailed distribution statistics
summarize gdp, detail

display ""
display "Key insight: Median ($`r(p50)') << Mean ($`r(mean)')"
display "This right-skewed distribution indicates more low-income countries globally"
```

## Regression Analysis

### Infant Mortality on GDP Per Capita

```{stata reg-mortality-gdp, warning=FALSE}
* Load wide-format data
use "wb_cleaned_wide.dta", clear

* Regression: infant mortality on GDP per capita
regress mortality gdp
```

Each additional \$1,000 in GDP per capita is associated with approximately 0.27 fewer infant deaths per 1,000 live births. The negative coefficient aligns with expectations: wealthier countries typically have better healthcare infrastructure.

### Literacy on GDP Per Capita

```{stata reg-literacy-gdp, warning=FALSE}
* Load wide-format data
use "wb_cleaned_wide.dta", clear

* Regression: adult literacy on GDP per capita
regress adult_literacy gdp
```

Higher GDP is associated with higher literacy rates, though the relationship is modest in magnitude.

### Infant Mortality on Literacy

```{stata reg-mortality-literacy, warning=FALSE}
* Load wide-format data
use "wb_cleaned_wide.dta", clear

* Regression: infant mortality on adult literacy
regress mortality adult_literacy
```

The strong negative relationship between literacy and mortality suggests that education may be one mechanism through which income improves health outcomes.

## Visualization

```{stata scatter-plot, warning=FALSE, results="hide"}
* Load wide-format data
use "wb_cleaned_wide.dta", clear

* Scatter plot with regression line and confidence interval
twoway (lfitci mortality adult_literacy) ///
       (scatter mortality adult_literacy, msymbol(circle_hollow)), ///
    ytitle("Infant Mortality (per 1,000 live births)") ///

    title("Infant Mortality vs. Adult Literacy Across Countries") ///
    legend(order(1 "95% CI" 2 "Fitted values" 3 "Countries")) ///

    scheme(s1mono)

graph export "mortality-literacy-scatter.png", replace width(1200)
```

## Methodological Note

::: {.callout-tip}
## Correlation vs. Causation

These regressions document correlational relationships—we cannot claim that increasing GDP would *cause* mortality to fall. Countries with lower mortality might grow faster (reverse causality), or omitted variables like institutional quality could drive both outcomes. Causal identification would require quasi-experimental methods like Regression Discontinuity Design or Instrumental Variables.

## Gender Gap in Literacy

```{stata gender-gap, warning=FALSE}
* Load wide-format data
use "wb_cleaned_wide.dta", clear

* Compare male vs female literacy
summarize male_literacy female_literacy

* Calculate the gap
generate literacy_gap = male_literacy - female_literacy
summarize literacy_gap, detail
```

The persistent gap between male and female literacy rates reflects socio-cultural norms in many low- and middle-income countries that historically prioritized boys' education.
