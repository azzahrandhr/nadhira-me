    "text": "In one of my class project, I got to pick a research study to replicate, and I immediately knew I wanted to work with this one when saw it online because it reminds me so much of what I see happening back home.\nIf you’ve ever spent time on Indonesian social media, you know how powerful netizens can be. A complaint about bad service goes viral on Twitter? Companies scramble to respond. A politician’s family member gets caught doing something shady and people start talking on Instagram? Before you know it, it’s on the national news. I’ve watched this happen over and over—people coming together online to make their voices heard, and actually getting results.\nWhile this research is not about that, it give a glimpse of insight into how this all works. It’s about understanding the mechanisms behind it. What makes some online movements take off while others fizzle out? How do institutions actually respond to online pressure? These are questions I find fascinating.\nSo for this replication project, I’m excited to get into the methodology and see what insights I can pull out that might help us better understand these digital dynamics.\n\n\n\nA growing body of research suggests that authoritarian regimes are responsive to societal actors, but understanding the sources of authoritarian responsiveness remains limited because of challenges in measurement and causal identification. (Chen, Pan, and Xu 2016) assess the main hypotheses in this literature by conducting an online field experiment across 2,103 (with 2,013 successfully posted) Chinese counties and examining the factors that shape officials’ incentives to respond to citizens in an authoritarian context. Existing research suggests that responsiveness among county-level officials in China may stem from three possible sources: a desire to mitigate the threat of collective action, a desire to appear capable in the eyes of upper-level officials, and a desire to satisfy party members. These arguments lead to three hypotheses for responsiveness among county-level governments in China:\n\nH1: Assignment to threats of collective action increases responsiveness of county-level officials to citizen demands.\nH2: Assignment to threats of evoking oversight from upper-level government increases responsiveness of county-level officials to citizen demands.\nH3: Assignment to claims of CCP membership and loyalty to the Party increases responsiveness of county-level officials to citizen demands.\n\nThe authors test these hypotheses by posting requests on county government web forums in China and tracking the responses they receive from government officials.\nThe outcome of interest is the responsiveness of county governments. Responsiveness was measured in four ways: (1) whether there was a response, (2) the timing of the response if one was given, (3) whether the response was viewable by the general public, and (4) the specific content of the response. The authors found that, at baseline, approximately one-third of county governments respond to citizen demands expressed online. They found statistically significant effects on responsiveness for both the threat of collective action and the threat of tattling to upper-level government. They found no statistically significant effect for requests in which the sender identified as a loyal, long-standing member of the Chinese Communist Party. Moreover, the authors also found that the threat of collective action made local officials more publicly responsive.\nThis replication is organized into two sections. I begin by replicating the main table of the article, and then proceed to explore the heterogenous treatment effect across counties with different unemployment rates and government fiscal capacities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my replication on Covariate Balance across Treatment Groups, it is confirmed that randomization was successful. All 27 covariates, including population, GDP, education level, and government fiscal indicators, are balanced across the four treatment groups. All p-values from the F-tests exceed 0.10. This indicates that there are no statistically significant differences between groups prior to treatment.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Covariate Balance Across Treatment Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Group\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nControl\nCA Threat\nTattle Threat\nLoyalty Claim\nP-value\n\n\n\n\nLog Population (2010)\n12.7\n12.7\n12.7\n12.8\n0.8\n\n\nLog Population (2000)\n12.7\n12.7\n12.7\n12.7\n0.9\n\n\nPopulation Growth\n5.1\n4.9\n5.0\n5.1\n0.8\n\n\nSex Ratio\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n1.1\n0.5\n\n\nLog Population Density\n14.8\n14.8\n14.9\n15.0\n0.5\n\n\nMigrant %\n16.8\n16.5\n17.1\n17.1\n0.9\n\n\nNon-Agricultural HH %\n29.1\n29.5\n29.1\n30.5\n0.6\n\n\nUrban %\n46.4\n46.9\n46.3\n48.1\n0.5\n\n\nEducation Years\n8.7\n8.7\n8.7\n8.8\n0.8\n\n\nIlliteracy %\n6.4\n6.3\n6.3\n6.3\n1.0\n\n\nMinor %\n17.1\n15.8\n15.7\n16.3\n0.8\n\n\nUnemployment %\n3.3\n3.3\n3.2\n3.4\n0.5\n\n\nWorkers in Agriculture %\n52.6\n51.8\n52.2\n50.5\n0.5\n\n\nWorkers in Industry %\n20.0\n20.4\n20.9\n21.3\n0.4\n\n\nWorkers in Services %\n27.2\n27.8\n26.9\n28.2\n0.5\n\n\nIncome\n25.3\n25.3\n24.4\n24.8\n0.8\n\n\nLog Income\n9.9\n9.9\n9.9\n9.9\n1.0\n\n\nLog GDP\n8.8\n8.8\n8.8\n8.9\n1.0\n\n\nAverage Growth\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n1.0\n\n\nLog Agricultural Output\n7.1\n7.1\n7.1\n7.1\n1.0\n\n\nLog Industrial Output\n8.0\n7.9\n8.0\n8.0\n1.0\n\n\nLog Service Output\n7.7\n7.7\n7.7\n7.7\n1.0\n\n\nNumber of Large Firms\n51.7\n51.4\n52.1\n49.9\n1.0\n\n\nLog Investment\n8.4\n8.4\n8.4\n8.4\n1.0\n\n\nLog Savings\n6.8\n6.8\n6.8\n6.8\n0.9\n\n\nLog Government Revenue\n5.7\n5.7\n5.8\n5.7\n1.0\n\n\nLog Government Expenditure\n7.2\n7.1\n7.1\n7.2\n0.9\n\n\n\nNote:  P-values from F-tests of joint significance across treatment groups.

The threat of collective action increases government responsiveness by about 7.7 pp in unconditional models (all counties) and about 10.1 pp in conditional models (counties where posts were successfully made). The threat of tattling to upper-level government shows similar effects, increasing responsiveness by 6.8 pp unconditionally and 8.3 pp conditionally. Claims of CCP loyalty show smaller, statistically insignificant effects of around 3–4 pp. These results are robust to the inclusion of prefectural fixed effects and sociodemographic controls.\n\n\n\nTable 2: The Causal Effects of Treatments on Government Responses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Response (0 or 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnconditional\n\n\nConditional\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT1: collective action threat\n\n\n0.077***\n\n\n0.065***\n\n\n0.066***\n\n\n0.101***\n\n\n0.090***\n\n\n0.102***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.030)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT2: tattling threat\n\n\n0.068***\n\n\n0.061***\n\n\n0.062***\n\n\n0.083***\n\n\n0.094***\n\n\n0.106***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.030)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT3: claims of loyalty\n\n\n0.033\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n0.040\n\n\n0.030\n\n\n0.042\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n0.232***\n\n\n0.350***\n\n\n0.161\n\n\n0.320***\n\n\n0.360***\n\n\n0.167\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.016)\n\n\n(0.122)\n\n\n(0.243)\n\n\n(0.020)\n\n\n(0.129)\n\n\n(0.300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefectural dummies\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nSociodemographic controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nForum characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.005\n\n\n0.272\n\n\n0.272\n\n\n0.007\n\n\n0.278\n\n\n0.347\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\np&lt;0.1; p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuber White robust standard errors are in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn examining the Causal Effect of Treatment on Publicly Viewable Responses, I observe whether the responses were made publicly viewable or not.

The replication also shows similar findings with the paper.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Proportion of Responses Made Public\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic/All\n\n\n\n\n\nT1: collective action threat\n0.093\n(0.045)\n\n\nT2: tattling threat\n-0.025\n(0.05)\n\n\nT3: claims of loyalty\n0.037\n(0.051)\n\n\nConstant (Control mean)\n0.663\n(0.037)\n\n\n\nNote:  Standard errors based on nonparametric bootstrapping (1,000 iterations).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplication of Content of Responses by Treatment Group shows similar findings to the original paper, illustrating how response content varies by treatment. The control group has a 76.8% non-response rate, while the collective action threat group has only 69.2%. More importantly, compared to the control (12.7%), the collective action threat produces the highest rate of direct information responses (18.5%). The tattling threat also increases direct information responses (16.9%). Lastly, tattling also increases deferral responses (7.0% versus 4.6% for the control).\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Content of Responses by Treatment Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Response\nDeferral\nReferral\nDirect Info\n\n\n\n\nControl\n551 (76.8%)\n33 (4.6%)\n42 (5.9%)\n91 (12.7%)\n\n\nT1: collective action threat\n496 (69.2%)\n36 (5%)\n52 (7.3%)\n133 (18.5%)\n\n\nT2: tattling threat\n502 (70%)\n50 (7%)\n44 (6.1%)\n121 (16.9%)\n\n\nT3: claims of loyalty\n528 (73.5%)\n39 (5.4%)\n58 (8.1%)\n93 (13%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, I examine whether the treatment effect varies across subgroups, specifically by unemployment rate characteristics across counties. I look for heterogeneous treatment effects by unemployment rate because high-unemployment areas might have greater potential risk for social unrest. When officials in high-unemployment counties see a collective action threat, they might respond differently: either being more responsive because there are more aggrieved citizens who might actually mobilize, or being less responsive because they regularly receive more complaints.\nTo categorize high and low unemployment rates, I split the sample at the median unemployment rate. The table below presents results split by the median unemployment rate (2.26%). Additionally, to formally test whether the observed differences are statistically significant, I conducted randomization inference. For unemployment rate, I conducted two-tailed tests examining whether treatment effects differ between high and low unemployment counties.\nThe findings reveal that treatment effects are notably larger in low-unemployment counties. For the collective action threat, the effect on responsiveness is 13.9 pp in low-unemployment areas versus 6.2 pp in high-unemployment counties. However, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.205). For public responses, the collective action effect is 15.0 percentage points in low-unemployment areas versus 6.0 percentage points in high-unemployment areas. This difference approaches marginal significance (p = 0.096), suggesting there may be some heterogeneity in how governments make responses publicly visible. For the tattling threat, the difference in effects on responsiveness between low and high unemployment counties is also not statistically significant (p = 0.497).\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Unemployment Rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Unemployment\n\n\nLow Unemployment\n\n\n\n\nResponse\nPublic\nResponse\nPublic\n\n\n\n\nT1: collective action threat\n0.062\n0.06\n0.139\n0.15\n\n\n\n(0.042)\n(0.039)\n(0.042)\n(0.038)\n\n\nT2: tattling threat\n0.063\n0.033\n0.102\n0.058\n\n\n\n(0.042)\n(0.038)\n(0.041)\n(0.036)\n\n\nT3: claims of loyalty\n-0.003\n0.017\n0.086\n0.064\n\n\n\n(0.041)\n(0.037)\n(0.042)\n(0.037)\n\n\nConstant\n0.332\n0.225\n0.308\n0.199\n\n\n\n(0.03)\n(0.026)\n(0.028)\n(0.025)\n\n\nObservations\n1052\n1052\n1051\n1051\n\n\nR-squared\n0.005\n0.003\n0.011\n0.015\n\n\n\nNote:  Huber White robust standard errors in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment fiscal capacity directly determines staffing levels, technical infrastructure, and additional resources that could be predictive of the paper’s outcome (responsiveness). My hypothesis here is that higher government fiscal capacity would show a larger effect on responsiveness.\nI use the same methodology for splitting. I split the sample by median log government revenue (5.85). Here, the pattern shows that the effects are slightly larger in high fiscal capacity counties (11.9% for collective action) compared to low fiscal capacity counties (9.2%). However, for public responses, the difference is more pronounced, as we observe that the collective action threat increases public responses by 14.0 percentage points in high fiscal capacity counties versus 7.3 percentage points in low fiscal capacity counties.\nFor government fiscal capacity, I conducted one-tailed tests based on the expectation that well-resourced governments would be more responsive to citizen demands. The test does not show statistically significant evidence that high-fiscal-capacity counties have higher responsiveness (p = 0.318) or higher public responses (p = 0.108). The latter approaches marginal significance, suggesting some evidence that governments with greater fiscal resources may be more likely to respond publicly when threatened with collective action. However, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of homogeneous treatment effects at conventional levels. This may reflect limited statistical power to detect heterogeneity within subgroups, or it may indicate that the true heterogeneity is modest in magnitude.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Government Fiscal Capacity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Fiscal Capacity\n\n\nLow Fiscal Capacity\n\n\n\n\nResponse\nPublic\nResponse\nPublic\n\n\n\n\nT1: collective action threat\n0.119\n0.14\n0.092\n0.073\n\n\n\n(0.043)\n(0.038)\n(0.042)\n(0.039)\n\n\nT2: tattling threat\n0.095\n0.052\n0.079\n0.036\n\n\n\n(0.043)\n(0.037)\n(0.041)\n(0.038)\n\n\nT3: claims of loyalty\n0.054\n0.057\n0.036\n0.025\n\n\n\n(0.043)\n(0.038)\n(0.04)\n(0.037)\n\n\nConstant\n0.345\n0.203\n0.285\n0.221\n\n\n\n(0.029)\n(0.025)\n(0.029)\n(0.026)\n\n\nObservations\n1031\n1031\n1030\n1030\n\n\nR-squared\n0.009\n0.013\n0.006\n0.004\n\n\n\nNote:  Huber White robust standard errors in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis replication successfully reproduces the main findings of Chen, Pan, and Xu (2016). Threats of collective action and threats of tattling to superiors both significantly increase government responsiveness in authoritarian China, while claims of party loyalty did not show any significant effect.\nThe extension analysis examines whether these effects are heterogeneous across county characteristics. Descriptively, treatment effects appear larger in counties with lower unemployment and higher fiscal capacity. However, randomization inference tests indicate that most of these differences are not statistically significant at conventional levels. For unemployment, the difference in collective action effects on public responses comes closest to significance (p = 0.096), but we cannot reject the null of equal treatment effects for responsiveness (p = 0.205) or for the tattling treatment (p = 0.497). For fiscal capacity, the one-tailed tests also fail to reach significance for responsiveness (p = 0.318), though the difference for public responses approaches marginal significance (p = 0.108). These findings suggest that either the study lacks sufficient power to detect treatment effect heterogeneity, or the true heterogeneity is modest in magnitude.\nThe original study provides compelling evidence that even vague threats of collective action can make authoritarian governments more responsive. My replication confirms these findings. While the extension suggests that local economic and fiscal conditions may moderate how officials respond to citizen demands, these patterns require further investigation with larger samples or more targeted designs to confirm.\n\n\n\n\n\nChen, Jidong, Jennifer Pan, and Yiqing Xu. 2016. “Sources of Authoritarian Responsiveness: A Field Experiment in China.” American Journal of Political Science 60 (2): 383–400. https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12207."

(Chen, Pan, and Xu 2016) assess the main hypotheses in this literature by conducting an online field experiment across 2,103 (with 2,013 successfully posted) Chinese counties and examining the factors that shape officials’ incentives to respond to citizens in an authoritarian context. Existing research suggests that responsiveness among county-level officials in China may stem from three possible sources: a desire to mitigate the threat of collective action, a desire to appear capable in the eyes of upper-level officials, and a desire to satisfy party members. These arguments lead to three hypotheses for responsiveness among county-level governments in China:\n\nH1: Assignment to threats of collective action increases responsiveness of county-level officials to citizen demands.\nH2: Assignment to threats of evoking oversight from upper-level government increases responsiveness of county-level officials to citizen demands.\nH3: Assignment to claims of CCP membership and loyalty to the Party increases responsiveness of county-level officials to citizen demands.\n\nThe authors test these hypotheses by posting requests on county government web forums in China and tracking the responses they receive from government officials.\nThe outcome of interest is the responsiveness of county governments. Responsiveness was measured in four ways: (1) whether there was a response, (2) the timing of the response if one was given, (3) whether the response was viewable by the general public, and (4) the specific content of the response. The authors found that, at baseline, approximately one-third of county governments respond to citizen demands expressed online. They found statistically significant effects on responsiveness for both the threat of collective action and the threat of tattling to upper-level government. They found no statistically significant effect for requests in which the sender identified as a loyal, long-standing member of the Chinese Communist Party. Moreover, the authors also found that the threat of collective action made local officials more publicly responsive.\nThis replication is organized into two sections. I begin by replicating the main table of the article, and then proceed to explore the heterogenous treatment effect across counties with different unemployment rates and government fiscal capacities."

The threat of collective action increases government responsiveness by about 7.7 pp in unconditional models (all counties) and about 10.1 pp in conditional models (counties where posts were successfully made). The threat of tattling to upper-level government shows similar effects, increasing responsiveness by 6.8 pp unconditionally and 8.3 pp conditionally. Claims of CCP loyalty show smaller, statistically insignificant effects of around 3–4 pp. These results are robust to the inclusion of prefectural fixed effects and sociodemographic controls.\n\n\n\nTable 2: The Causal Effects of Treatments on Government Responses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Response (0 or 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnconditional\n\n\nConditional\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT1: collective action threat\n\n\n0.077***\n\n\n0.065***\n\n\n0.066***\n\n\n0.101***\n\n\n0.090***\n\n\n0.102***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.030)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT2: tattling threat\n\n\n0.068***\n\n\n0.061***\n\n\n0.062***\n\n\n0.083***\n\n\n0.094***\n\n\n0.106***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.030)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT3: claims of loyalty\n\n\n0.033\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n0.040\n\n\n0.030\n\n\n0.042\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n0.232***\n\n\n0.350***\n\n\n0.161\n\n\n0.320***\n\n\n0.360***\n\n\n0.167\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.016)\n\n\n(0.122)\n\n\n(0.243)\n\n\n(0.020)\n\n\n(0.129)\n\n\n(0.300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefectural dummies\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nSociodemographic controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nForum characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.005\n\n\n0.272\n\n\n0.272\n\n\n0.007\n\n\n0.278\n\n\n0.347\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\np&lt;0.1; p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuber White robust standard errors are in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn examining the Causal Effect of Treatment on Publicly Viewable Responses, I observe whether the responses were made publicly viewable or not.

    "text": "In this section, I examine whether the treatment effect varies across subgroups, specifically by unemployment rate characteristics across counties. I look for heterogeneous treatment effects by unemployment rate because high-unemployment areas might have greater potential risk for social unrest. When officials in high-unemployment counties see a collective action threat, they might respond differently: either being more responsive because there are more aggrieved citizens who might actually mobilize, or being less responsive because they regularly receive more complaints.\nTo categorize high and low unemployment rates, I split the sample at the median unemployment rate. The table below presents results split by the median unemployment rate (2.26%). Additionally, to formally test whether the observed differences are statistically significant, I conducted randomization inference. For unemployment rate, I conducted two-tailed tests examining whether treatment effects differ between high and low unemployment counties.\nThe findings reveal that treatment effects are notably larger in low-unemployment counties. For the collective action threat, the effect on responsiveness is 13.9 pp in low-unemployment areas versus 6.2 pp in high-unemployment counties. However, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.205). For public responses, the collective action effect is 15.0 percentage points in low-unemployment areas versus 6.0 percentage points in high-unemployment areas. This difference approaches marginal significance (p = 0.096), suggesting there may be some heterogeneity in how governments make responses publicly visible. For the tattling threat, the difference in effects on responsiveness between low and high unemployment counties is also not statistically significant (p = 0.497).\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Unemployment Rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Unemployment\n\n\nLow Unemployment\n\n\n\n\nResponse\nPublic\nResponse\nPublic\n\n\n\n\nT1: collective action threat\n0.062\n0.06\n0.139\n0.15\n\n\n\n(0.042)\n(0.039)\n(0.042)\n(0.038)\n\n\nT2: tattling threat\n0.063\n0.033\n0.102\n0.058\n\n\n\n(0.042)\n(0.038)\n(0.041)\n(0.036)\n\n\nT3: claims of loyalty\n-0.003\n0.017\n0.086\n0.064\n\n\n\n(0.041)\n(0.037)\n(0.042)\n(0.037)\n\n\nConstant\n0.332\n0.225\n0.308\n0.199\n\n\n\n(0.03)\n(0.026)\n(0.028)\n(0.025)\n\n\nObservations\n1052\n1052\n1051\n1051\n\n\nR-squared\n0.005\n0.003\n0.011\n0.015\n\n\n\nNote:  Huber White robust standard errors in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment fiscal capacity directly determines staffing levels, technical infrastructure, and additional resources that could be predictive of the paper’s outcome (responsiveness). My hypothesis here is that higher government fiscal capacity would show a larger effect on responsiveness.\nI use the same methodology for splitting. I split the sample by median log government revenue (5.85). Here, the pattern shows that the effects are slightly larger in high fiscal capacity counties (11.9% for collective action) compared to low fiscal capacity counties (9.2%). However, for public responses, the difference is more pronounced, as we observe that the collective action threat increases public responses by 14.0 percentage points in high fiscal capacity counties versus 7.3 percentage points in low fiscal capacity counties.\nFor government fiscal capacity, I conducted one-tailed tests based on the expectation that well-resourced governments would be more responsive to citizen demands. The test does not show statistically significant evidence that high-fiscal-capacity counties have higher responsiveness (p = 0.318) or higher public responses (p = 0.108). The latter approaches marginal significance, suggesting some evidence that governments with greater fiscal resources may be more likely to respond publicly when threatened with collective action. However, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of homogeneous treatment effects at conventional levels. This may reflect limited statistical power to detect heterogeneity within subgroups, or it may indicate that the true heterogeneity is modest in magnitude.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Government Fiscal Capacity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Fiscal Capacity\n\n\nLow Fiscal Capacity\n\n\n\n\nResponse\nPublic\nResponse\nPublic\n\n\n\n\nT1: collective action threat\n0.119\n0.14\n0.092\n0.073\n\n\n\n(0.043)\n(0.038)\n(0.042)\n(0.039)\n\n\nT2: tattling threat\n0.095\n0.052\n0.079\n0.036\n\n\n\n(0.043)\n(0.037)\n(0.041)\n(0.038)\n\n\nT3: claims of loyalty\n0.054\n0.057\n0.036\n0.025\n\n\n\n(0.043)\n(0.038)\n(0.04)\n(0.037)\n\n\nConstant\n0.345\n0.203\n0.285\n0.221\n\n\n\n(0.029)\n(0.025)\n(0.029)\n(0.026)\n\n\nObservations\n1031\n1031\n1030\n1030\n\n\nR-squared\n0.009\n0.013\n0.006\n0.004\n\n\n\nNote:  Huber White robust standard errors in parentheses."

    "text": "This replication successfully reproduces the main findings of Chen, Pan, and Xu (2016). Threats of collective action and threats of tattling to superiors both significantly increase government responsiveness in authoritarian China, while claims of party loyalty did not show any significant effect.\nThe extension analysis examines whether these effects are heterogeneous across county characteristics. Descriptively, treatment effects appear larger in counties with lower unemployment and higher fiscal capacity. However, randomization inference tests indicate that most of these differences are not statistically significant at conventional levels. For unemployment, the difference in collective action effects on public responses comes closest to significance (p = 0.096), but we cannot reject the null of equal treatment effects for responsiveness (p = 0.205) or for the tattling treatment (p = 0.497). For fiscal capacity, the one-tailed tests also fail to reach significance for responsiveness (p = 0.318), though the difference for public responses approaches marginal significance (p = 0.108). These findings suggest that either the study lacks sufficient power to detect treatment effect heterogeneity, or the true heterogeneity is modest in magnitude.\nThe original study provides compelling evidence that even vague threats of collective action can make authoritarian governments more responsive. My replication confirms these findings. While the extension suggests that local economic and fiscal conditions may moderate how officials respond to citizen demands, these patterns require further investigation with larger samples or more targeted designs to confirm."
