    "text": "In one of my class project, I got to pick a research study to replicate. When I saw this paper online, I immediately knew that I wanted to work with this one. Why? because it reminds me of what I see happening back home.\nI think Indonesian netizens can be incredibly powerful and sometimes quite scary. A complaint about bad service on Twitter? Companies go into damage-control mode 🔥. A politician’s family member gets caught doing something shady and people start talking on Instagram? Before you know it, it’s on the national news. I’ve watched the power of people coming together online to make their voices heard, and actually getting results.\nThis research reminds me of that, it give a glimpse of insight into how this authoritarian respond to society. It’s about understanding the mechanisms behind it.\n How do institutions actually respond to online pressure?\nSo for this replication project, I’m excited to get into the methodology and see what insights I can pull out that might help us better understand these digital dynamics."

    "text": "Causal Effect of Treatments on Government Responses\nFor the Causal Effect of Treatments on Government Responses replication, I find that it closely matches the original findings. The threat of collective action increases government responsiveness by about 7.7 pp in unconditional models (all counties) and about 10.1 pp in conditional models (counties where posts were successfully made). The threat of tattling to upper-level government shows similar effects, increasing responsiveness by 6.8 pp unconditionally and 8.3 pp conditionally. Claims of CCP loyalty show smaller, statistically insignificant effects of around 3–4 pp. These results are robust to the inclusion of pref ectural fixed effects and sociodemographic controls.\n\nCode\n# Run models using lm() \n# Model 1: Unconditional - no controls\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3, data = d)\n\n# Model 2: Unconditional - with prefecture FE\nmodel2 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3 + factor(city), data = d)\n\n# Model 3: Unconditional - with FE + sociodemographic controls\nmodel3 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3 + factor(city) + \n               logpop + nonagrhh + urban + eduyr + unemploy + minor, \n             data = d)\n\n# Models 4-6: Conditional on posted == 1\nd_posted &lt;- subset(d, posted == 1)\n\nmodel4 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3, data = d_posted)\n\nmodel5 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3 + factor(city), data = d_posted)\n\nmodel6 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3 + factor(city) + \n               logpop + nonagrhh + urban + eduyr + unemploy + minor +\n               forum_response + forum_recent_response + forum_imme_viewable +\n               post_email + post_name + post_idnum + post_tel + post_address,\n             data = d_posted)\n\n# Get robust SEs for each model\nrobust_se &lt;- list(\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model1, type = \"HC1\"))),\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model2, type = \"HC1\"))),\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model3, type = \"HC1\"))),\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model4, type = \"HC1\"))),\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model5, type = \"HC1\"))),\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model6, type = \"HC1\")))\n)\n\nstargazer(model1, model2, model3, model4, model5, model6,\n          type = \"html\",  \n          se = robust_se,\n          keep = c(\"tr1\", \"tr2\", \"tr3\", \"Constant\"),\n          covariate.labels = c(\"T1: collective action threat\",\n                               \"T2: tattling threat\", \n                               \"T3: claims of loyalty\"),\n          dep.var.labels = \"Government Response (0 or 1)\",\n          column.labels = c(\"Unconditional\", \"Conditional\"),\n          column.separate = c(3, 3),\n          add.lines = list(\n            c(\"Prefectural dummies\", \"\", \"yes\", \"yes\", \"\", \"yes\", \"yes\"),\n            c(\"Sociodemographic controls\", \"\", \"\", \"yes\", \"\", \"\", \"yes\"),\n            c(\"Forum characteristics\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"yes\")\n          ),\n          omit.stat = c(\"f\", \"ser\", \"adj.rsq\"),\n          notes = \"Huber White robust standard errors are in parentheses.\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: The Causal Effects of Treatments on Government Responses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Response (0 or 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnconditional\n\n\nConditional\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT1: collective action threat\n\n\n0.077***\n\n\n0.065***\n\n\n0.066***\n\n\n0.101***\n\n\n0.090***\n\n\n0.102***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.030)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT2: tattling threat\n\n\n0.068***\n\n\n0.061***\n\n\n0.062***\n\n\n0.083***\n\n\n0.094***\n\n\n0.106***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.030)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT3: claims of loyalty\n\n\n0.033\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n0.040\n\n\n0.030\n\n\n0.042\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n0.232***\n\n\n0.350***\n\n\n0.161\n\n\n0.320***\n\n\n0.360***\n\n\n0.167\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.016)\n\n\n(0.122)\n\n\n(0.243)\n\n\n(0.020)\n\n\n(0.129)\n\n\n(0.300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefectural dummies\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nSociodemographic controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nForum characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.005\n\n\n0.272\n\n\n0.272\n\n\n0.007\n\n\n0.278\n\n\n0.347\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\np&lt;0.1; p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuber White robust standard errors are in parentheses."

    "text": "Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Government Fiscal Capacity\nGovernment fiscal capacity directly determines staffing levels, technical infrastructure, and additional resources that could be predictive of the paper’s outcome (responsiveness). My hypothesis here is that higher government fiscal capacity would show a larger effect on responsiveness.\nI use the same methodology for splitting. I split the sample by median log government revenue (5.85). Here, the pattern shows that the effects are slightly larger in high fiscal capacity counties (11.9% for collective action) compared to low fiscal capacity counties (9.2%). However, for public responses, the difference is more pronounced, as we observe that the collective action threat increases public responses by 14.0 percentage points in high fiscal capacity counties

fiscal capacity, I conducted one-tailed tests based on the expectation that well-resourced governments would be more responsive to citizen demands. The test does not show statistically significant evidence that high-fiscal-capacity counties have higher responsiveness (p = 0.318) or higher public responses (p = 0.108). The latter approaches marginal significance, suggesting some evidence that governments with greater fiscal resources may be more likely to respond publicly when threatened with collective action. However, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of homogeneous treatment effects at conventional levels. This may reflect limited statistical power to detect heterogeneity within subgroups, or it may indicate that the true heterogeneity is modest in magnitude. # Conclusion\nThis replication successfully reproduces the main findings of Chen, Pan, and Xu (2016). Threats of collective action and threats of tattling to superiors both significantly increase government responsiveness in authoritarian China, while claims of party loyalty did not show any significant effect.\nThe extension analysis examines whether these effects are heterogeneous across county characteristics. Descriptively, treatment effects appear larger in counties with lower unemployment and higher fiscal capacity. However, randomization inference tests indicate that most of these differences are not statistically significant at conventional levels. For unemployment, the difference in collective action effects on public responses comes closest to significance (p = 0.096), but we cannot reject the null of equal treatment effects for responsiveness (p = 0.205) or for the tattling treatment (p = 0.497). For fiscal capacity, the one-tailed tests also fail to reach significance for responsiveness (p = 0.318), though the difference for public responses approaches marginal significance (p = 0.108). These findings suggest that either the study lacks sufficient power to detect treatment effect heterogeneity, or the true heterogeneity is modest in magnitude.\nThe original study provides compelling evidence that even vague threats of collective action can make authoritarian governments more responsive. My replication confirms these findings. While the extension suggests that local economic and fiscal conditions may moderate how officials respond to citizen demands, these patterns require further investigation with larger samples or more targeted designs to confirm."
