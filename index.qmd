  <h1>Hi, I'm Nadhira! 👋</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a first year graduate student in **Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences** at Columbia University, previously I work as a data analyst in [Traveloka](https://www.traveloka.com/en-en) and [OCBC](https://www.ocbc.com/business-banking). My interest focuses in the field of data analysis, causal inference, and field experimentation, particularly as tools to create meaningful societal impact. You can get in touch with me via email [nah2181@columbia.edu](mailto:nah2181@columbia.edu) or at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/azzahrandhr)
