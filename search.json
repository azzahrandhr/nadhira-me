    "text": "This analysis started as one of my class assignments in Economic Development at Columbia. The task was to think through experiment designs of a study evaluating mobile health clinics on prenatal care utilization in rural Rajasthan, India.\nUnlike my previous post on World Bank indicators (which was purely correlational), this one dives into causal inference. DiD lets us estimate treatment effects when we have observational data before and during the period of intervention.\nDiD is one of the most widely used quasi-experimental method in empirical economics. It is particularly valuable in context where randomized controlled trial may be infeasible. However, this method also often use in combination with randomization because the key insight of DiD is that we can observe the change over time in untreated units, adjusting any baseline difference between control and treatment groups.\nIn this post I’ll walk through the design, the assumptions to make, and show how to implement it in Stata. This post serves as both a personal reference and hopefully can be a useful resource for others learning causal inference methods."

    "text": "Parallel Trends\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningThe Key Assumption\n\n\n\nDiD requires that without treatment, both groups would have followed the same trend. This is called the parallel trends assumption. It’s untestable in the treatment period, but we can check whether trends were parallel before treatment.\n\n\nIn our example, suppose treatment villages had 2.1 prenatal visits in 2022 while control villages had 2.3. This baseline difference doesn’t invalidate DiD—the method accounts for level differences by looking at changes rather than absolute levels.\nWhat would be concerning is if the groups were on different trajectories before treatment. If we had data from 2020 and 2021, we could test this by:\n\nVisual inspection: Plot average prenatal visits over time for both groups. The lines should be roughly parallel before 2023.\nPlacebo test: Run DiD on the pre-treatment periods. If we find a “treatment effect” before treatment actually happened, something is wrong."

    "text": "Causal Effect of Treatments on Government Responses\nFor the Causal Effect of Treatments on Government Responses replication, I find that it closely matches the original findings. The threat of collective action increases government responsiveness by about 7.7 pp in unconditional models (all counties) and about 10.1 pp in conditional models (counties where posts were successfully made). The threat of tattling to upper-level government shows similar effects, increasing responsiveness by 6.8 pp unconditionally and 8.3 pp conditionally. Claims of CCP loyalty show smaller, statistically insignificant effects of around 3–4 pp. These results are robust to the inclusion of pref ectural fixed effects and sociodemographic controls.\n\nCode\n# Run models using lm() \n# Model 1: Unconditional - no controls\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3, data = d)\n\n# Model 2: Unconditional - with prefecture FE\nmodel2 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3 + factor(city), data = d)\n\n# Model 3: Unconditional - with FE + sociodemographic controls\nmodel3 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3 + factor(city) + \n               logpop + nonagrhh + urban + eduyr + unemploy + minor, \n             data = d)\n\n# Models 4-6: Conditional on posted == 1\nd_posted &lt;- subset(d, posted == 1)\n\nmodel4 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3, data = d_posted)\n\nmodel5 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3 + factor(city), data = d_posted)\n\nmodel6 &lt;- lm(response ~ tr1 + tr2 + tr3 + factor(city) + \n               logpop + nonagrhh + urban + eduyr + unemploy + minor +\n               forum_response + forum_recent_response + forum_imme_viewable +\n               post_email + post_name + post_idnum + post_tel + post_address,\n             data = d_posted)\n\n# Get robust SEs for each model\nrobust_se &lt;- list(\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model1, type = \"HC1\"))),\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model2, type = \"HC1\"))),\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model3, type = \"HC1\"))),\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model4, type = \"HC1\"))),\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model5, type = \"HC1\"))),\n  sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model6, type = \"HC1\")))\n)\n\nstargazer(model1, model2, model3, model4, model5, model6,\n          type = \"html\",  \n          se = robust_se,\n          keep = c(\"tr1\", \"tr2\", \"tr3\", \"Constant\"),\n          covariate.labels = c(\"T1: collective action threat\",\n                               \"T2: tattling threat\", \n                               \"T3: claims of loyalty\"),\n          dep.var.labels = \"Government Response (0 or 1)\",\n          column.labels = c(\"Unconditional\", \"Conditional\"),\n          column.separate = c(3, 3),\n          add.lines = list(\n            c(\"Prefectural dummies\", \"\", \"yes\", \"yes\", \"\", \"yes\", \"yes\"),\n            c(\"Sociodemographic controls\", \"\", \"\", \"yes\", \"\", \"\", \"yes\"),\n            c(\"Forum characteristics\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"yes\")\n          ),\n          omit.stat = c(\"f\", \"ser\", \"adj.rsq\"),\n          notes = \"Huber White robust standard errors are in parentheses.\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: The Causal Effects of Treatments on Government Responses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Response (0 or 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnconditional\n\n\nConditional\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT1: collective action threat\n\n\n0.077***\n\n\n0.065***\n\n\n0.066***\n\n\n0.101***\n\n\n0.090***\n\n\n0.102***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.030)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT2: tattling threat\n\n\n0.068***\n\n\n0.061***\n\n\n0.062***\n\n\n0.083***\n\n\n0.094***\n\n\n0.106***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.022)\n\n\n(0.030)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT3: claims of loyalty\n\n\n0.033\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n0.040\n\n\n0.030\n\n\n0.042\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.023)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.021)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.029)\n\n\n(0.028)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n0.232***\n\n\n0.350***\n\n\n0.161\n\n\n0.320***\n\n\n0.360***\n\n\n0.167\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.016)\n\n\n(0.122)\n\n\n(0.243)\n\n\n(0.020)\n\n\n(0.129)\n\n\n(0.300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefectural dummies\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nSociodemographic controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nForum characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,869\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n2,103\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.005\n\n\n0.272\n\n\n0.272\n\n\n0.007\n\n\n0.278\n\n\n0.347\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\np&lt;0.1; p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuber White robust standard errors are in parentheses."

    "text": "Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Government Fiscal Capacity\nGovernment fiscal capacity directly determines staffing levels, technical infrastructure, and additional resources that could be predictive of the paper’s outcome (responsiveness). My hypothesis here is that higher government fiscal capacity would show a larger effect on responsiveness.\nI use the same methodology for splitting. I split the sample by median log government revenue (5.85). Here, the pattern shows that the effects are slightly larger in high fiscal capacity counties (11.9% for collective action) compared to low fiscal capacity counties (9.2%). However, for public responses, the difference is more pronounced, as we observe that the collective action threat increases public responses by 14.0 percentage points in high fiscal capacity counties versus 7.3 percentage points in low fiscal capacity counties.\n\n\nCode\n# Remove NAs\nd_posted_clean2 &lt;- d_posted[!is.na(d_posted$high_gov_rev) & \n

fiscal capacity, I conducted one-tailed tests based on the expectation that well-resourced governments would be more responsive to citizen demands. The test does not show statistically significant evidence that high-fiscal-capacity counties have higher responsiveness (p = 0.318) or higher public responses (p = 0.108). The latter approaches marginal significance, suggesting some evidence that governments with greater fiscal resources may be more likely to respond publicly when threatened with collective action. However, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of homogeneous treatment effects at conventional levels. This may reflect limited statistical power to detect heterogeneity within subgroups, or it may indicate that the true heterogeneity is modest in magnitude. # Conclusion\nThis replication successfully reproduces the main findings of Chen, Pan, and Xu (2016). Threats of collective action and threats of tattling to superiors both significantly increase government responsiveness in authoritarian China, while claims of party loyalty did not show any significant effect.\nThe extension analysis examines whether these effects are heterogeneous across county characteristics. Descriptively, treatment effects appear larger in counties with lower unemployment and higher fiscal capacity. However, randomization inference tests indicate that most of these differences are not statistically significant at conventional levels. For unemployment, the difference in collective action effects on public responses comes closest to significance (p = 0.096), but we cannot reject the null of equal treatment effects for responsiveness (p = 0.205) or for the tattling treatment (p = 0.497). For fiscal capacity, the one-tailed tests also fail to reach significance for responsiveness (p = 0.318), though the difference for public responses approaches marginal significance (p = 0.108). These findings suggest that either the study lacks sufficient power to detect treatment effect heterogeneity, or the true heterogeneity is modest in magnitude.\nThe original study provides compelling evidence that even vague threats of collective action can make authoritarian governments more responsive. My replication confirms these findings. While the extension suggests that local economic and fiscal conditions may moderate how officials respond to citizen demands, these patterns require further investigation with larger samples or more targeted designs to confirm."

Reason is because in data without randomization presents, there could be reverse causality (e.g Lower mortality might cause countries to grow faster instead of Rich countries might cause lower mortality rates), or omitted variables (e.g like institutional quality could drive both mortality and gdp). To reduce this possibility we would require randomization or quasi-experimental methods like Regression Discontinuity Design or Instrumental Variables.
